    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p id="opening">In this page I will show how I created this fun project and explain each joint individually. For this project unlike the barbeque scraper research was not needed as we already had a complete design we had to replicate. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sketchup</li>
        <span>Just as with the barbeque scraper, I recreated my design on sketchup to make sure it works, fits, and looks good.
             If you haven't read the barbeque scraper section, sketchUp is a 3D modeling computer program for a wide range of drawing applications such as architectural, interior design, and landscape architecture, but can also be used for many more applications.    This is how my design looks on SketchUp.</span>

        <li>Drawing</li>
        <span>After getting all my pieces of wood and knowing what my design is going to be I drew the correct measurements on the wood planks. Here is how it looked</span>

        <li>Making the joints</li>
        <span>Below are the steps I took to create each one of the five joints.</span>
    </ol>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="butt joint">
            <h3>Butt Joint</h3>
            <p>Probably the easiest joint to make. A butt joint is a joint that is connected by taking to pieces and just butting them together. On the longer piece I have cut of two inches because the width of the pieces of wood are two inches. I then put
                the smaller piece in the place of where the two inches were cut from.</p>
            <p><img src="buttDrawing.jpg" class="flip"></p>
            <p>To stabilize it better I then took the smaller piece of wood and made a hole right in the middle of the two inches it overlaps using the drill press.</p>
            <p><img src="buttWithAHole.jpg" class="flip"></p>
            <p>I then held the two pieces together with a clamp, drilled a hole through them with a hand drill, added glue, and screwed a screw once again with a hand drill.</p>
            <p><img src="screwAndGlueInButt.jpg" class="flip"></p>
            <p>Then put more glue above the screw, took a small piece of wood and put it in.</p>
            <p><img src="closeTheButt.jpg" class="flip"></p>
            <p>After putting the piece of wood I chopped whatever popped out with a saw and have finished the butt joint. I have not glued or screwed the other joints.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mitre joint">
            <h3>Mitre Joint</h3>
            <p>Also a very easy joint to make is the mitre joint. Firstly I drew the lines on the two pieces of wood I needed to cut. I drew a 45 degree line starting at the corner at spanning two inches in width and height.</p>
            <p><img src="mitreDrawing.jpg" class="flip"></p>
            <p>Then I used a mitre saw and cut on the lines by lining up the cut line under the saw turning the machine on and pressing down on the machine until it cut through.</p>
            <p><img src="mitreCut.jpg" class="flip"></p>
        </div>
        <div class="half joint">
            <h3>Half Lap Joint</h3>
            <p>To create the half lap joint I took the two pieces I needed for the joint and on the two inches it will overlap I drew a line straight across the middle of the height. In my example the pieces were one inch thick so I drew the line one half
                inch up.
            </p>
            <p><img src="halfDrawing.jpg"></p>
            <p>I then went on to the table saw with a dado blade and set the height of the blade for half the thickness of the wood and the distance of the blade from the side to two inches. I pushed my pieces of wood a small part at a time on to the blade
                until the half lap was done on both sides. Here is how it looked at the end.</p>
            <p><img src="halfCut.jpg" class="flip"></p>
        </div>
        <div class="mortise joint">
            <h3>Mortise And Tenon Joint</h3>
            <p>Just as in all the other joints, the first step in creating this joint is to draw the lines on the wood. For the mortise and tenon I went to the edge and drew lines 3/8" from the left and right side and 1/4" from the top and bottom to create
                the rectangle which will let the tenon go in the mortise.</p>
            <p><img src="tenonDrawing.jpg"></p>
            <p>I then went over to the table saw with a dado blade and set the height of the blade to 3/8" and the width to 2". After setting the measurements, I put the longer piece of wood on the table which will be the tenon, turned on the machine and
                a small bit by bit I pushed my wood across the blade then moved the wood a bit to the right and did it again until the blade cut of 2". Then flipped the piece of wood and did the same thing to the other side. Once again I changed the height
                of the blade this time to 1/4" placed my wood on the table pressed hard with my left hand while with my right pushed the wall that held the wood in place and did the same as before. I then went to the band saw and cut off 3/4" as it will
                only overlap 1 1/4" and not the full two. I drew a line 3/4" inch from the side went to the band saw, turned on the machine and with my hands out of the way I pushed my wood through cutting on the waste line. When I finished cutting I
                turned off the machine, wait for the blade to stop, and took my wood.</p>
            <p><img src="tenonCut.jpg" class="flip"></p>
            <p>After finishing my tenon I moved to my mortise. For the mortise cut I went to the mortise press. I placed my wood down between two walls, adjusted the place of my wood so the blade will be exactly above the bottom right corner. I turned on
                the machine moved my finger out of the way and pressed down on the handle so the blade would cut my wood. After it cut the bottom right corner, I moved my wood to the right so the machine will continue cutting. After reaching the bottom
                left corner I turned the machine off and turned my wood around so the blade will be above the top right corner. I did the same as before and my mortise cutting from top right to left until the reaching the top left corner. I then turned
                off the machine removed my wood and the mortise joint was complete.</p>
            <p><img src="mortise.jpg" class="flip"></p>
            <p>Now my mortise and tenon joint was complete.</p>
            <p><img src="mortiseTenon1.jpg"></p>
            <p><img src="mortiseTenon2.jpg"></p>
        </div>
        <div class="dovetail joint">
            <h3>Dovetail Joint</h3>
            <p>The hardest joint for me was definitely the dovetail joint. While there are machines to create this joint, we didn't have them at our school so we had to create them by hand. Once again I firstly drew the lines. </p>
            <p><img src="dovedrawing.jpg" class="flip"></p>
            <p>The shorter part of the dovetail was one inch long, the long part was 1 1/2", and the depth was 1/2".<br>To do the part of the dovetail joint that goes over we first have to take the piece of wood to the table saw with a dado blade. You set
                the height of the blade to 1/2" so it will cut the bottom 1/2" and be able to overlap with the other piece of the joint which will have a depth of 1/2". Then you set the width two inches and begin. Just as before you press hard with your
                left hand while your right hand pushes the wall that the wood is stacked on and do that multilple times until you have cut two inches of the bottom. Since we are making two dovetail joints you then flip the piece of wood and do the same
                thing to the other side.</p>
            <p><img src="dovetailCut.jpg"></p>
            <p>You then take the piece of wood to the band saw to angle the top part of the joint. Once you are on the band saw you turn on the machine and cut on the waste line, the two long lines the make the trapezoid shape. You then cut the small line
                between the edge and the bottom of your joint so the waste pieces would fall off. I then took a rasp to remove some wood to the pencil line, since I cut on the waste line with the band saw, and this is how it looks now.</p>
            <p><img src="doveComplete.jpg"></p>
            <p><br>For the lower part of the dovetail I took a saw and inside the pencil drawn shape on the wood I cut many lines to 1/2" in depth. I did this so I could then remove the wood between the saw lines with a chisel and the dovetail joint would
                be complete. That is easier said than done because after the long time of sawing straight lines in the wood came the even longer time of remove and straighting the wood with a chisel. After I finished that I used rasp to remove some wood
                from the sides of the cut so the hole would be bigger. I continued using the rasp until the dovetail joint fit inside. The process of creating the dovetail joint took hours and was definitley the hardest joint and the one I made the most
                mistakes with.</p>
            <p>I then did the same thing for the other side.</p>
            <p><img src="underPartOfDove.jpg" class="flip"></p>
            <p>And the dovetail fit.</p>

        <li>Sanding</li>
        <span>After finishing all the joints I have sanded all the pieces. Unlike the barbeque scraper where I did it by hand this time I got to use the palm sander. A tool used for sanding that when you turn it on replicates the movement of sanding but much faster. It was very useful because instead of wasting an hour on each piece like I did on the barbeque scraper, I finished it in two minutes. To use the palm sander have your pieces in front of you turn on the machine and begin sanding the pieces. When finished turn off machine and take your pieces with you.<br>This was one of the pieces after sanding. Much nicer with a consistent color and no knots </span>
        <p><img src="sanded.jpg" class="flip"></p>
        <li>Finishing</li>
        <span>Now my project is complete and I have put all my pieces together.</span>
