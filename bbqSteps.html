    <h1>Barbeque Scraper</h1>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p id="opening">There are multiple steps that I took to create the barbeque scraper, which include both planning and execution steps.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Research</li>
        <span>The first step in creating the bbq scraper is researching and figuring out what type of barbeque grill scraper you want. (handle, thickness, hole, size, roundness, etc). I looked at other examples to get an idea for what I wanted mine to look like.</span>
        <li>Sketchup</li>
        <span id="back">The second step I took to create the scraper is drawing a 3d version of the barbeque scraper on sketchup.
             SketchUp is a 3D modeling computer program for a wide range of drawing applications such as architectural, interior design, and landscape architecture, but can also be used for many more applications.    This is how my design looks on SketchUp.</span>
        <a id="a" href="bbqSketchup.html">Design</a>
        <li>Drawing On paper</li>
        <span>The third step is drawing a real-life size diagram of your barbeque scraper on a long piece of paper.
                It is very important to be very precise with your measurement because a small mistake could decrease the efficiency and quality of your woodworking project.
                <p><img src="BBQDrawing.jpg" class="drawing"></p></span>
        <li>Drawing on wood</li>
        <span>After finishing drawing the diagram onto my paper, I then copied it onto the wood.</span>
        <p><img src="woodBBQ.jpg" class="drawing"></p>
        <li>Tools & machines</li>
        <span>Now it is time to start cutting and using the machines. The first machine I used was the band saw.
            (You can read more in tools). To use the band saw stand in front of the machine, never on the side, put your wood flat on the table, and keep your hands at least 50mm away from the blade.
        Then, start the machine and slowly push your wood through the blade, always cut on the waste side and never make sharp turns. If sharp turns are needed, do something called a relief cut. A relief cut is when you make two or more cuts from different
        angle to cut a piece of the wood off.
        <p><img src="relief.png"></p>
        If you made a cut always turn off your machine before taking your piece of wood out of the blade as it can hurt the blade and ruin your work. And always use a wooden stick to remove scrap pieces of wood of the table to reduce chance of injury.
        </span><br><br>
        <span>
            After finishing with the band saw I headed over to the oscillating spindle sander which I have used to round out all the cuts and to get the outer layer closer to the line.
            When using the oscillating spindle sander, turn on the machine and slowly push your wood onto the sander. Don't push too hard, let the machine do the work.
            Than the machine will start to gradually remove the outer layer of the wood from the direction you pushed it.
            Continue until satisfaction and then turn off the machine.
        </span><br><br>
        <span>
            Next I headed over to the file, which I have used to remove and straighten any waste beside corners and sides.
            When using the file, hold the tool by the handle and "scrape" the flat side wherever you need to.
            <p><img src="file.webp"></p>
        </span>
        <span>
            After the file, I used the sand paper.
            Take a small scrap piece of wood and wrap the sand paper around it.
            than scrape the sand paper on the sides of the project to smooth it out and to remove the last layer of waste.
            <p><img src="sand.webp"></p>
        </span>
        <span>
            This how my project looks up to right now.
            <p><img src="almostComplete.jpg" class="drawing flip"></p></span>
        <li>Drill Press</li>
        <span>
                Now it is time to make the hole in the handle and I did that using the drill press. For my design I have made a pretty big hole so I had to connect a circle hole cutter to the drill saw.
                <p><img src="hole.jpg" class="drill"><p>(This is the circe hole cutter)</p></p>
                When using the drill press it is important to lay your work down flat on the table and hold it tight, so for that I used a cam clamp.
                <p><img src="clamp.jpg" class="drill"><p>(This is the cam clamp)</p></p>
                <span></span>I lined up my wood with the drill, used the clamp to hold my project, I then turned on the machine and made a hole almost all the way through. Then I flipped my work and did the other side as well at the exact same
        spot to make the hole nicer and cleaner. This how my barbeque scraper looked after the drill press.
        <p><img src="AfterDrillPress.jpg" class="drawing flip"></p>
        </span>
        <li>Rouding the edges</li>
        <span>Rounding the edges is a nice step you can add and I added in creating a barbeque scraper.
            I used the router power tool with the roundover bit which is used to round out edges.
            When using the router make sure your bit is in good condition, before turning on the machine make sure the bit isn't touching the stock (wood) yet, turn on the machine and slowly while keeping your hands away start pushing the wood onto the tool.
            Slowly push the wood in the opposite direction of which the bit is rotating and round out every side.
            When finished I flipped my work and did the same to the other side.
            This is how my project looks after the router.
            <p><img src="RoundedOut.jpg" class="drawing flip"></p>
        </span>
        <li>Angled edge part 1/2</li>
        <span>After rounding the edges I made the angle at the front of the scraper.
            I used three machines for it: the table saw with a dado blade, a 45 degree angle mitre saw, and the disc sander.
            I used the table and mitre saw to make it easier and take less time on the disc sander.
            <br><br><span>
                I first used the mitre saw to cut a 45 degree angled straight cut to remove some of the waste wood off.
                To use the mitre saw stand in front of the machine and put your right hand on the trigger, never cross hands.
                If it is a sliding saw always push the saw away from you.
                Get the blade to the angle and place you want, turn on the machine and push the saw through the wood.
                When you are done turn off the machine before pulling the mitre saw out. 
            </span>
        <br><br>
        <span>
                After using the mitre saw I headed over to the table saw with a dado blade.
                A dado blade is used for to cut dados in wood.
                A dado cut is cut which removes a "block" of wood from your work.
                <p><img src="dado.jpg"><p>(This is an example of a dado cut)</p></p>
                I used the dado blade to remove many small portions of wood from the waste side.
                After using the two machines  this is how my project looks.
                <p><img src="dodo.jpg" class="flip drawing"></p>
            </span>
        </span>
        <li>Angled edge part 2/2</li>
        <span>
            Now it is time to use the disc sander.<p class="small">Just a reminder that you can read more about the tools at the tools page (access at the top).</p>
            <p><span></span>When using the disc sander line up your work straight up (it is very important that it is parallel to the sander), keep your fingers away from the disc sander, turn on the machine, and push your wood against the disc
        sander on the <i>rotating-down side.</i></p>
        This how my project looks right now, with only one step left:
        <p><img src="AfterDiscSander.jpg" class="drawing flip"></p>
        </span>
        <li>Last Step (sanding)</li>
        <span>And the final step of this project is sanding with sand paper.
            Now when you are sanding this time you have to make sure every side is smooth, looks and feels exactly like you want it.
            It took me about an hour and 45 minutes of just sanding.
            I used multiple types of sandpaper which are 120, 150, 180, and 220.
            After completing the final step of my barbeque scraper, this is my final design.<br>
            PS: You can add a rope through the hole if you'd like.
