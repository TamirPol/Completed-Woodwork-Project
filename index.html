            <h2>Barbeque Scraper</h2>
            <p>
                The first project that I have created in tech class was the barbeque scraper. A tool used to clean the barbeque after a good day of grilling. I have created the barbeque scraper from a 2" by 6" by 1" cedar board with woodworking tools, hand tools, and
                sand paper.

            <h2>Joineries</h2>
            <p>
                The second project that I have created in tech class was the joineries. Joineries are ways to connect pieces of wood together. There are thirteen different joineries and I learned how to create five in this project. The butt joint, mitre joint, dovetail
                joint, half lap joint, and the mortoise and tenon joint.

            <h2>Planter Box</h2>
            <p>
                My last project this year is the planter box. The planter box is the most difficult project I had thus far because I have to create the design my self with a limited amount of wood, 6-7 board feet.
