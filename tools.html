            <h1>Band Saw</h1>
            <p><span>A</span> bandsaw is a power saw with long sharp blade consisting of many metal teeth. The band saw is mainly used in woodworking and metalworking. The purpose of a band saw is to cut out shapes in wood, plastic, or metal. One of its
                advantages over other saws is its ability to cut out irregular or curved sides and shapes.
                <br><br><span>When </span>using the bandsaw it is important to keep your fingers at least 50mm away from the blade and stand in front of the blade. Adjust the top of the blade approximately 6 mm above the material to be cut and always
                cut on the waste side of the line. When removing small scrap pieces all use a wooden stick.

                <span>D</span>isk sanders are prefabricated disks of sand paper. The Disk Sander is used to smooth materials such as woods and plastics. It is also used to remove small amounts of waste material.<br><br>
                <span>When</span> using the disc sander remove all saw dust and only sand on dry wood. Also always sand on the <i>rotating-down side surface</i> of the sander and never sand if the abrasive paper is loose or torn. Keep your fingers at
                least four inches away from the sander and do not push the material too hard against the machine. The wood must be positioned against the table at all times when using the machine.

                <span>The drill press is a machine used for making holes in hard surfaces such as wood and plastic.
                    The drill is held in a rotating spindle and is fed into the work piece.<br><br>
                    <span> When</span> drilling deep holes withdraw the drill often to prevent burning and damaging to the drill. To prevent hand injuries, secure the work piece to the table. Always use scrap piece of wood under the work
                to prevent damage to the drill press table and always brush the table with a shop brush. Secure the drill bit in the chuck by placing the chuck key in one of the three holes and twisting firmly. For a better finished cut, locate the center
                of a hole to be drilled with an X.

                <span>An</span> oscillating spindle sander or OSS for short, is used for sanding curves. An OSS is a machine which consists of a tabletop witch a sanding drum sticking out through a hole in the top of the table. The drum is covered with
                abrasive sleeve, while also rotating and moving up and down.<br><br>
                <span>Never</span> try to sand metal as it could start a fire and don't leave the machine unless it has come to a complete stop. When sanding, sand against the direction the spindle is spinning. Do not leave the machine until it has come
                to a complete stop.

            <p>
                <span>A</span> Mitre saw is a saw which its purpose is to cut straight angled cuts and miters on wood or plastic. A mitre saw consists of a table and a circular blade which is mounted on a swing arm that pivots left and right to cut angled
                cuts.
                <br><br>
                <span>When </span>using the band saw, always put your <b>right hand</b> on the trigger and never cross hands when cutting or reaching for materials. If you're making a slide cut, push the saw away from you, if you're cutting a 90 degree
                cut, use a square for your final cut. When cutting keep one hand on the handle and the other off the table and never place your hand close to the blade whether the machine is on or off. Cut slowly, and use a stop when cutting multiple
                pieces the same length. Always secure the wood with either your hand or a clamp if the piece is too small and in the no hands zone.

                <span>The</span> table saw consists of a long table as well as a small circular saw blade that is driven by an electric motor. A table saw's purpose is to cut accurate and precise cuts on wood such as cross cuts, ripping cuts, and dado
                cuts.
                <br><br>
                <span>When</span> using the table saw, the saw blade should be adjusted so just one tooth will be above the wood. Never rip something that is wider than it is long and 12 inches is the minimum length for ripping. Always use a fence or
                a mitre box, freehand cuts are not allowed on the table saw, and never stand in line with the blade or wood in case of a kickback.

            <h1>Router</h1>
            <p>
                <span></span> router is a hand tool or power tool used for making hollowed out wood or decorative edges such as rounded edges. You can connect different bits to the router which do different things such as a chamfer bit which produce a
                bevel cuts at a given angle, or rabbeting bits which are used to cut a rabbets in wood.<br><br>
                <span></span>When using the router, before turning on the machine check if the router bit is sharp and in good condition. Don't try to remove a lot of material in one cut, make several passes, and plan the cuts don't over reach. Do not
                turn off the router until the bit is away from the stock. If using the router table keep your hands far away from the rotating bit and make sure the fence is secure if the router has one. Make sure that the stock that is going to be routed
                is in good condition and doesn't have any knots, splits or checks and free of paint or hardware. And lastly the direction of the feed should always be against the rotation of the bit, or it will run on you.

                <span></span> palm sander is a hand-held tool inevented in 1976 by Festool. It used to sand down smaller pieces and replicates sanding by hand but at a much faster speed. Palm sanders are one of the cheaper power tools which you can find
                in less than $50.<br><br>
                <span></span>When using the palm sander have the piece of wood you want sanded in front of you, turn on the machine by pressing the small switch, and begin sanding. To sand simply go over the wood with the machine, press slightly and move
                the machine back and forth. When finished turn off machine, wait for the machine to stop, and take your wooden pieces away from the table.

                <span></span>A mortise press or a mortiser is a power tools used to make rectangular holes in wood such as for mortise and tenon joints. The mortise press is made from multiple pieces which include the switch which turns it on, the square
                tenon bit which is the blade that makes the rectangular hole, the backer and wall platens which is used to hold down the wood in place, and the handle which lowers the tenon bit to make a hole.<br><br>
                <span></span>To use a mortise press place the part of the wood you want to make a hole in directly under the tenon bit, tighten the wood with the wall platen, and turn on the machine. Then pull the handle down until it make a hole the
                depth that you want, pull the bit out and turn off the machine.
